# Watchlister: Your Ultimate Movie & TV Show Tracker

Track, discover, and enjoy movies and TV shows effortlessly. Watchlister helps you build a personalized watchlist, keep tabs on your viewing progress, and explore new content with rich details and trailers.

## Installation

To get Watchlister up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Idris-jose/watchfinder.git
cd watchfinder
```

### Install Dependencies
Install all required project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Watchlister relies on Firebase and TMDB for its functionality. You need to set up a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys and configuration from Firebase and TMDB.

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID"
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY"
```

**Note:** The Firebase configuration is found in `src/firebase-config.js`. For production, it's best practice to protect these keys. For local development, using a `.env` file and Vite's `VITE_` prefix for environment variables is appropriate.

### Start the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
